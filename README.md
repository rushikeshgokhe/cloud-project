# Static Website Hosting using Amazon S3

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates hosting a static website on Amazon S3 using AWS cloud services. 
The website was deployed by configuring S3 bucket permissions, enabling static website hosting, and applying appropriate IAM and bucket policies.

- Amazon S3
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- AWS Management Console

## Project Workflow
1. Created an S3 bucket
2. Configured public access settings
3. Enabled static website hosting
4. Uploaded HTML and CSS files
5. Applied bucket policy for public access
6. Verified website accessibility via S3 endpoint

## Key Learnings
- AWS S3 static website hosting
- Bucket policies and access control
- IAM permission basics
